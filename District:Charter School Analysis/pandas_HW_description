The first thing that I saw was that the charter schools overall passing rate was higher than the district schools'.
The second thing that caught my eye was that smaller school size along with lower spending per student 
resulted in better overall scores. So, maybe when they go back to the next budget meeting, they should consdier pouring more
of the money into providing the kids with the stuff they need, such as general school supplies. They should also look 
into considering splitting up certain district schools in to smaller sized campuses to give the students a more one-on-one feel.
