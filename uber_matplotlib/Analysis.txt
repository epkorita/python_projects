The first thing that I took away from this was the fares are much higher in Rural areas. This is largely because these areas are 
normally very spread out which would drive the fare price up.
The second thing I noticed was that the driver volume and ride count was highest in the urban areas. This is due to proximity and high population of a Urban city geographic. 
The third observation would be that there is a pretty substantial difference in the Urban rides to driver count. This shows that just because you're a driver, doesn't mean you will get as many riders as you may think.
